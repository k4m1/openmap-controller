# Maps drawn by players

WoW Forever's own dungeons have no map in the game. The maps here were drawn by players who let
OpenMap use them; each is credited on the map in game ("Map by ..."). They are not Blizzard's art
and not covered by OpenMap's MIT licence: ask the artist before using them anywhere else.

`chart/` holds the sea chart round the world map (Options' Responsive ocean & border: the sea, compass roses, sea
creatures, ships and frame), painted by Santiago Reyes and used with his permission; not covered by the
MIT licence either (see its README).

`gaps/` holds the gaps between zones painted by hand on Blizzard's own art (see its README); like the
dungeon maps, they're used with the artist's permission and aren't covered by the MIT licence.

`python -P tools/map-dungeons/drawn.py` turns them into `OpenMap/Media/Textures/MapDungeonDrawn/`
and `OpenMap/Data/DungeonDrawn.lua`. A new one: add the drawing here (a 3:2 picture, the dungeon
map's 1002 x 668 shape) and a line to the script's `DRAWN` (by the dungeon's mapID in
`OpenMap/Data/Places.lua`, or by its name there where that mapID is 0; a dungeon of more than one
floor lists each floor's drawing with the floor's name).
